# Frogger V1.0 – 20 Games Challenge (Game 2)

This is the **third** game in my [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/#3) — a personal journey to improve my game development skills by creating 20 small games from scratch.



## 🎮 Game Overview

Frogger is a 2D arcade-style game where the player controls a frog trying to reach the top. The challenge lies in minimizing time and deaths while navigating through obstacles and terrain.  
My game is a simple, minimalist recreation of the arcade game, made in Unity using C#.
